# Image-Binarization-on-Pynq-Z2-using-VHDL-and-Python
This project implements image binarization, transforming grayscale images into binary (black-and-white) representations. It uses a thresholding technique to separate foreground and background based on pixel intensity. The result is a simplified, high-contrast image with many uses like document processing or object detection.
